This program (genS.c) takes two input parameters: number
of files and configuration file name. For example, if a
user enters ./genS 4 config.dat, the program would
generate 4 text files in the data directory. The
filenames are 1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt and 4.txt. In the
data directory, there is also a configuration file
named config.dat (as specified as the second parameter)
that lists all the generated data files. For example,
the content of config.dat, based on the above command
example, would be:

1.txt
2.txt
3.txt
4.txt
