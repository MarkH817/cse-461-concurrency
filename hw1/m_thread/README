This program (genM.c) is intended to be the
multithreaded version of gen.c. It also takes two input
parameters: number of files and configuration file
name. For example, if a user enters ./genM 4
config.dat, the program should generate 4 text files in
the data directory (however, it is not the case at the
moment). The filenames should be 1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt
and 4.txt. In the data directory, there is also a
configuration file named config.dat (as specified as
the second parameter) that lists all the generated data
files. For example, the content of config.dat, based on
the above command example, should be:

1.txt
2.txt
3.txt
4.txt
